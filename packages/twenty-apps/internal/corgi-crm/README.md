# Corgi CRM app

This internal Twenty app owns Corgi-specific CRM automation. It does not own the
existing `Wholesaler` object, which was created before this app.

## Installation order

1. Run `crm-workspace-metadata-bootstrap.yml` from the exact SHA deployed to
   both CRM services. Supply its exact successful run and attempt to step 2.
2. Run `corgi-crm-app-production.yml` from that same exact SHA. It verifies the
   bootstrap evidence before its schema preflight, then publishes, installs,
   and reconciles the app-created WorkspaceMember links.
3. Run `crm-territory-identity-discovery.yml` from the same SHA and supply the
   successful app-install run and attempt. This read-only phase emits only the
   three immutable WorkspaceMember UUIDs and an aggregate hash.
4. Run `crm-workspace-config.yml` from the same SHA, supplying all three UUIDs
   explicitly plus the discovery run and attempt. The workflow rejects UUIDs
   that differ from the PII-safe discovery artifact before any mutation.
5. The manifest defaults `CORGI_CRM_WORKSPACE_ID` to the approved Corgi CRM
   workspace. Do not publish or install this tenant-specific app elsewhere.

The post-install function reconciles all existing WorkspaceMembers. The
`workspaceMember.created` trigger keeps future members synchronized. Both paths
reuse a case-insensitive email match, create a deterministic record ID from the
WorkspaceMember ID when no match exists, and fail closed on ambiguous matches.
They default the custom `wholesalerRole` field (displayed as “Role”) and do not
allocate leads.

The production workflow verifies the live ECS image digest, authenticated
workspace, required schema, installed version, active database trigger, and
one-to-one member reconciliation. It authenticates with the existing production
smoke-test credentials, creates a uniquely named 30-minute API key for the run,
masks its token, and always attempts verified revocation. No persistent app
deployment credential belongs in the manifest, workflow, or repository.
